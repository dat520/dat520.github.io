## QuickFeed

This course uses [QuickFeed](https://uis.itest.run/), a tool developed at the University of Stavanger for students and teaching staff to manage the submission and validation of lab assignments.
All lab submissions from students are handled using Git and GitHub.
Thus, basic knowledge of these tools are necessary.
The procedure used to submit your lab assignments is explained in the [lab submission process](lab-submission.md).

Students push their updated lab submissions to GitHub.
Every lab submission is then processed by QuickFeed.
This tool will run several test cases on the submitted code.
QuickFeed generates feedback that let students verify if their submission implements the required functionality.
This feedback is available through QuickFeed's web interface.
Students are expected to use this feedback to improve their submissions.
There are no restrictions on the number of submissions you can make, but we suggest that you run any provided tests locally before submitting it to QuickFeed.

## Git and GitHub

Git is a distributed revision control and source code management system.
Basic knowledge of Git is required for handing in the lab assignments.
There are many great resources available online for learning Git.

- A good book is [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book).
  Chapter 2.1 and 2.2 should contain the necessary information for delivering the lab assignments.

- Here is a playlist of short [videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0lo9MOBetEFcp4SCWinBdpml9B2U25-f) about getting started with Git and GitHub.
